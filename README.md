# Boo!
Project files for my Unity-based 3D game.
"Boo!" is a quirky horror game, made for scares and/or laughs. Get ready to experience three major scares! Click or tap on the objects and see what happens (when too scared, you can always use the Esc key).  Also, If you're up to it, you can even try and push the Ultimate Scare button, when you see one.  Behold and beware the Ultimate Scare!
